# AligNET: A Web Application for Mapped NGS Reads using Open-Source Genome Browser Libraries
Authors: Jamie Mari O. Ciron and Mylah Rystie U. Anacleto

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) refers to technology used to determine the composition of genomic data, which is essential in medical and evolutionary biology. However, generated reads provide little information on their own, and require to be aligned onto a reference through mapping. Mapped reads may be viewed through genome browsers, which are software that provide an overview of the genome and allows for annotation and analysis. While conventional genome browsers allow for a more extensive examination, displaying genomic data in a comprehensive manner is a bottleneck given the complexity of these types of data as well as technological limitations such as storage, memory, and screen size. The study has developed an application that specializes in visualizing mapping results, which not only simplifies the user interface but also lessens the risk for errors in analysis. Existing genome browser libraries were also integrated to provide access to reliable and well-maintained visualization features. The application was evaluated by groups of biology students and bioinformaticians from the University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os (UPLB) using the System Usability Scale (SUS), resulting in scores of 89.00 and 95.00 respectively which are both considered above average.
